# Building LLM context from the session tree

`internal/session/manager.go` keeps every session message in a tree. Entries
are never deleted: compaction summarizes old history into a new node instead of
removing it, so the tree only grows. `buildSessionContext` walks one branch of
that tree on every context-cache miss to produce the messages sent to the LLM.
This document explains what the context must contain, why the original
implementation did work proportional to the *whole* branch, and how the
optimized version bounds the work by the *output*.

## Data model

Entries form a tree linked by parent ID. A conversation branch is the chain
from its leaf back to the first message (the session header sits at
`entries[0]` but is not part of the message chain).

```
root message ── m1 ── … ── F ── … ── C ── … ── leaf
```

- `C` is the newest **compaction entry**: an LLM-written summary of the
  history below it, stored as a normal tree node whose parent is the last
  message at compaction time.
- `F` (`C.Compaction.FirstKeptEntryID`) marks the retention boundary: the
  compaction summarized everything below `F`; from `F` upward messages stay
  verbatim. When a compaction happens, the session is cut somewhere in the
  recent window and `F` names the first kept entry.
- History below `F` is dead for context purposes. It stays in the tree for
  replay and diagnostics, but it can never appear in LLM context again.

The context produced for a branch is, oldest first:

1. the newest compaction entry (its summary reads as history the model no
   longer sees verbatim), then
2. every message from `F` up to the leaf.

Older compaction entries are never re-emitted; only the newest one leads.
Without any compaction the context is simply the whole branch.

## Original implementation

The original `buildSessionContext` did, for every call:

1. walk the branch from the leaf to the root through `byID`, collecting every
   ancestor — **including all summarized history below `F`**;
2. reverse that path;
3. scan it for the newest compaction entry;
4. scan from the compaction back down to the root for `FirstKeptEntryID`;
5. emit the retained tail.

It also preallocated the path with `make([]MessageEntry, 0, len(entries))`,
sized to the *entire* session, not the branch being walked.

Worst case (no compaction) is output-bound at O(branch depth) and fine.
But once a compaction exists the context is usually a small tail while the
branch keeps every historical round, so steps 1–4 re-traverse dead history
on every call. Sessions that are compacted repeatedly accumulate unbounded
dead history, making each context build more expensive than the last even
though the output stays small.

## Optimized implementation

Key observation: the walk can stop at the retention boundary. Once the walk
(from the leaf upward) reaches the newest compaction `C` and reads its
`FirstKeptEntryID`, nothing below that ID can reach the output, so there is no
reason to keep walking toward the root.

The rewrite is a single bounded walk, newest first:

```text
up = []
current = leaf
loop:
  up.push(current)
  if no compaction seen yet and current is a compaction entry:
      C = current; keepFrom = C.FirstKeptEntryID
      if keepFrom is empty: break          # summary is authoritative
  if keepFrom is set and current.ID == keepFrom:
      break                                # retention boundary reached
  current = byID[current.parent]           # stop at chain root / missing parent
```

Emission then prepends the compaction entry and appends the kept messages from
oldest to newest (skipping non-message entries, matching the original filter).
`up` grows from a small capacity to what is actually walked.

- No compaction: the walk still drains the branch — required, the output *is*
  the branch.
- With compaction: only the compaction plus the retained tail (`F` upward) is
  walked, so the cost is O(context size), independent of total history.

## Behavioural equivalence

The rewrite is intentionally behaviour-preserving. Edge cases match the
original:

- **Only the newest compaction leads.** The original picked the last
  compaction in the root-first path; the new code detects the first one
  encountered walking up — the same node.
- **Empty `FirstKeptEntryID`**: nothing below the summary stays verbatim; the
  walk stops at the compaction immediately (original kept `firstKeptIdx =
  compactionIdx`).
- **Dangling `FirstKeptEntryID`** (not on the branch): the original fell back
  to keeping only messages above the compaction; the new code walks to the
  chain root, finds no match, and applies the same fallback.
- **Older compaction nodes inside the retained tail** are filtered out of the
  output, as before.

The only intentional behavioural difference is defensive: an empty entry list
with an unknown leaf used to panic on `entries[len(entries)-1]`; it now
returns `nil`.

## Verification

- Existing session tests (load/replay/manager) pass unchanged.
- New regression subtests in `TestBuildSessionContext` pin the compaction
  semantics: multi-round compaction (round 1's compaction and its history must
  not leak into the context), empty `FirstKeptEntryID`, and dangling
  `FirstKeptEntryID`.
- `TestBuildSessionContextMatchesReference` keeps the original implementation
  in the test file as an oracle and compares both against 2000 deterministic
  random branches (messages plus 0–3 compaction entries with empty, dangling,
  or real keep-from IDs). This is the strongest guarantee that the rewrite
  produces identical output.

## Benchmarks

Representative numbers, Apple M4, `-benchtime=300ms -benchmem`
(reproduce with `go test -run '^$' -bench BenchmarkBuildSessionContext
-benchmem ./internal/session/`):

| Scenario | Optimized | Reference (old) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| compactedHistory (~5000 summarized + 50 kept) | 1.6 µs, 2.5 KB, 3 alloc | 151 µs, 84 KB, 6 alloc |
| forkedShortBranch (10000 other + 30 current) | 0.8 µs, 1 KB, 2 alloc | 11 µs, 165 KB, 7 alloc |
| noCompaction (2000 messages) | 65 µs, 9 alloc | 70 µs, 14 alloc |

Two caveats keep the numbers honest:

- The 97× gap on `compactedHistory` is the scenario where the old code did the
  most dead work; short uncompacted sessions show only constant-factor
  differences.
- In absolute terms the whole call is tens of microseconds against LLM round
  trips of seconds. The practical value is not latency but complexity: work no
  longer grows with total session history, so very long, repeatedly compacted
  sessions stay cheap and predictable.
